            <p class=" md:leading-normal" style="line-height: 30px; text-align: justify;">The traditional username and passwords approach used in most authentication system is susceptible to sniffing and may be insecurely stored. Some persons tend to use strong passwords but it becomes difficult to remember several strong password for different accounts. As a result, this project work proposes the development of a novel multifactor authentication system for secure and efficient access control which will have a good balance of security and convenience. It combines Personal Identification Number (PIN), One-Time-Password (OTP) and Quick Response (QR) to achieve optimal Security in authentication system. A cryptographic hash function is used in generating the OTP and it is delivered to the user through Short Message Service (SMS). After the design and implementation, the system proved to be an efficient system that adds another security layer in authentication systems. </p>
